# Managed Agents — PHP

> **Bindings not shown here:** This README covers the most common managed-agents flows for PHP. If you need a class, method, namespace, field, or behavior that isn't shown, WebFetch the PHP SDK repo **or the relevant docs page** from `shared/live-sources.md` rather than guess. Do not extrapolate from cURL shapes or another language's SDK.

> **Agents are persistent — create once, reference by ID.** Store the agent ID returned by `$client->beta->agents->create` and pass it to every subsequent `->sessions->create`; do not call `agents->create` in the request path. The Anthropic CLI is one convenient way to create agents and environments from version-controlled YAML — its URL is in `shared/live-sources.md`. The examples below show in-code creation for completeness; in production the create call belongs in setup, not in the request path.

## Installation

```bash
composer require "anthropic-ai/sdk" "guzzlehttp/guzzle:^7"
```

## Client Initialization

```php
use Anthropic\Client;

// Default (uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var)
$client = new Client();

// Explicit API key
$client = new Client(apiKey: 'your-api-key');
```

---

## Create an Environment

```php
$environment = $client->beta->environments->create(
    name: 'my-dev-env',
    config: ['type' => 'cloud', 'networking' => ['type' => 'unrestricted']],
);
echo "Environment ID: {$environment->id}\n"; // env_...
```

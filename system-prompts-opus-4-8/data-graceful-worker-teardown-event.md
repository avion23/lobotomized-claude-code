  Remote-control event-stream note for opt-in graceful worker teardown events
  and how clients should interpret them
ccVersion: 2.1.178
-->
Emitted by the bridge on opt-in graceful worker teardown (only when the teardown caller supplied a reason), before the heartbeat stops, so remote clients can show why the worker went away instead of waiting for heartbeat timeout. Absence is NOT a dead-host signal: handoffs (/update, /teleport, respawn), auto-disable, mode transitions, and internal fatal-error paths emit nothing by design. A dead host (battery, OOM, kill -9) never reaches teardown and never sends this either. NOTE: this event lands in the durable per-session event stream — a session that is later resumed may carry historical instances mid-stream. Clients MUST treat it as a live-tail signal only (honored when no further activity follows), not a one-shot session-lifetime fact. CC-2656.

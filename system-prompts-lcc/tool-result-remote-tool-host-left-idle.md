  Explains a computer stopped serving the session because it was idle and how to
  ask for the folder again

${TOOL_RESULT_REMOTE_TOOL_HOST_LEFT_IDLE_VAR_0} stopped serving this session because the session had run nothing on it for a while: an idle computer frees its place for other sessions. Nothing on ${TOOL_RESULT_REMOTE_TOOL_HOST_LEFT_IDLE_VAR_0} needs restarting and there is nothing to ask the user to fix. If the task still needs ${TOOL_RESULT_REMOTE_TOOL_HOST_LEFT_IDLE_VAR_0}, look the user's computer folders up and ask for that folder again (the user approves the request); otherwise do the rest of the task without it. Do not call ${TOOL_RESULT_REMOTE_TOOL_HOST_LEFT_IDLE_VAR_0} with "${TOOL_RESULT_REMOTE_TOOL_HOST_LEFT_IDLE_VAR_1}" until it is attached again.

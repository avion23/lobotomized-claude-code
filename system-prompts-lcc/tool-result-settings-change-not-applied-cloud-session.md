description: >-
  Settings-file edit not applied because a cloud session cannot take the
  required at-computer approval

Not applied: ${TOOL_RESULT_SETTINGS_CHANGE_NOT_APPLIED_CLOUD_SESSION_VAR_0} was NOT modified. A change to a Claude Code settings file applies only when a person approves it at the computer that Claude Code runs on, and a cloud session cannot take that approval. Approving the edit in this session does not apply it. The /settings-review command does not run in a cloud session, and on another computer it would not list this change. Tell the user what you meant to change. If the file is committed to a repository, the user can make the change themselves outside this session and push it. Do not retry the edit or try to make the same change another way.

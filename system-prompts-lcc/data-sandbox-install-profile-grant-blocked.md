The sandbox account and network filters are installed, but the read access to your user profile was left as it was: it is changed only while no sandboxed session or command is running on this machine, and one is (another Claude Code window, or this one if it has run a sandboxed command). Close the sessions that use the sandbox, then run `claude sandbox install` in a terminal, or /sandbox install in a new session.

  Sandboxed commands cannot connect to localhost; symptoms and what not to

On Windows, sandboxed commands cannot connect directly to localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1), even to their own port: the connect fails (EACCES, WinError 10013 or "Permission denied") or the program hangs silently, with no `<sandbox_violations>` block. A Python program hangs as soon as it starts an `asyncio` event loop, whether or not it uses the network. Gradle ("Could not connect to the Gradle daemon") and `dotnet test` fail for the same reason. Kill a hung command rather than wait, and do not try other addresses or ports.

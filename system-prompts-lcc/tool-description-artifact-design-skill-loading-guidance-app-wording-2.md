**Before writing the file, Claude must load the \`${TOOL_DESCRIPTION_ARTIFACT_DESIGN_SKILL_LOADING_GUIDANCE_APP_WORDING_2_VAR_0}\` skill**, including for a \`.md\` file that a skill told Claude to write. The skill sets how much design effort the request deserves; the Format rule above settles the format, and Claude never writes Markdown to get around the design pass.${TOOL_DESCRIPTION_ARTIFACT_DESIGN_SKILL_LOADING_GUIDANCE_APP_WORDING_2_VAR_1?TOOL_DESCRIPTION_ARTIFACT_DESIGN_SKILL_LOADING_GUIDANCE_APP_WORDING_2_VAR_2:""} Claude then writes the content to a file (via Write/Edit) and calls Artifact with its path, putting the file in its scratchpad directory when the system prompt lists one and the person names no other location.

**Skeleton**: publish wraps the file in a \`<!doctype html>…<head>…</head><body>\` skeleton, so Claude writes the page content directly, starting with its own \`<title>\` and \`<style>\` and no \`<html>\`, \`<head>\` or \`<body>\` tags. That head carries only a charset and viewport meta (with \`viewport-fit=cover\`) plus a small reset: light \`color-scheme\`, \`:root\` padded top and bottom by the phone's safe-area insets, zero body margin with a 14px system font, \`img{max-width:100%}\` and \`[hidden]{display:none!important}\` (so Claude toggles visibility with \`el.hidden\`, not \`style.display\`). Claude keeps that \`:root\` padding: a bar fixed to the top or bottom adds \`env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)\` or \`env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)\` to its own padding, and a sticky header uses \`top: env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px)\`, not \`0\`.

  Description of the `attributionProject` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

The claude.ai Project this session names for your organization's usage reports: the Project's UUID, or its ID starting with "claude_proj_". An empty string names none and stops lower-precedence files from naming one; the organization default still applies. Sent only when Claude Code uses your claude.ai login, connects directly to the Anthropic API, is not in a cloud session, and CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER is not 0. CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_PROJECT takes precedence over it. Set in managed settings, it overrides people's own settings files. A project's .claude/settings.json and settings.local.json count only once the folder is trusted; for runs in a folder nobody has trusted, such as CI, use CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_PROJECT.

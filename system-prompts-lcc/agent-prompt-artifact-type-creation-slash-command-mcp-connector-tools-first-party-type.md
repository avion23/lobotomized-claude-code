  Agent Prompt: Artifact type creation slash command (MCP connector tools,
  first-party type)
description: >-
  Directs an Artifact creation slash command for a type with no quickstart
  intent, with MCP connector tools, to skip quickstart, list types, take the
  first-party row, and create it
ccVersion: 2.1.304
variables:
  - ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME
  - ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE
  - ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE
-->
\`/${ARTIFACT_COMMAND_NAME}\` was invoked: a request for ${ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE} made as a NEW Artifact from the published Artifact type titled "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}". Skip any quickstart step your artifact tools have, which has no option for this type: list all the Artifact types they offer this user and take the first-party type titled "${ARTIFACT_TYPE_TITLE}" (a first-party row starts with a tier in brackets, such as \`[core]\`; if no row has one, go by title alone; if more than one row fits, ask the user which before creating). Create the new Artifact from it with a \`title\` drawn from the brief and nothing else yet, because the result of that call carries the type's instructions, then fill it by following them. If no type that fits is offered to this user, say so plainly and offer to make ${ARTIFACT_NOUN_PHRASE} another way.
